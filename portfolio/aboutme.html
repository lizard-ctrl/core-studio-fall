        <div id="text" style="font-size: xx-large;"><br>I am a 22 year old artist residing in Brooklyn exploring the magic of the internet. Iâ€™m a programmer working with physical computation, internet art, and experimental video work. Being part of the first generation of people growing up on social media my work is very influenced by my early internet experiences. <br><br> Growing up I often stayed up all night in chatrooms, on Tumblr, or interacting with friends I made via the internet. My aim with my work is to bring back the sense of magic we all felt exploring the internet for the first time alone. <br><br> An important part of my mission is also creating tools for sex workers, the LGBTQ community, and internet explorers. Creating spaces of care online for communities that I am part of is helping me transform the internet landscape into a safer space while also spreading knowledge. </div>
