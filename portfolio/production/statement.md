I am a 22 year old artist residing in Brooklyn exploring the elusive magic of the internet. Iâ€™m a programmer working with the weapons of physical computation, internet art, and experimental video work. Being part of the first generation of digital natives my work is very influenced by my early internet experiences. Growing up I often stayed up all night in chatrooms, on Tumblr, or interacting with friends I made via the internet. My aim with my work is to bring back the sense of magic we all felt exploring the internet for the first time alone. I am somewhat of a maximalist and seek inspiration in the crazy colored, gif filled, somewhat anti-design works of early net art. I also create tools for sex workers, the LGBTQ community, and internet explorers.


### *Design value #1  site as story*

- Evoking emotion and creating a narrative is definitely design concept #1. I want users to feel they are taking something away when they leave.

### *Design value #2 create curiosity*

- Have hidden interactions or parts of the site that are not so obvious upon first glance to encourage the user to engage. This I think creates interest and the want to search + find more information.
- Create curiosity within myself for projects too. Creating the need to learn more and do more.

### *Design value #3 accessibility*

- Designing sites that can be used by the average computer owner. Something thats not too hard to navigate and encourages them to think differently about how we engage with sites.
