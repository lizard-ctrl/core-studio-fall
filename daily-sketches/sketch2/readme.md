!!!!Hey!!!!
This is my self as systems project :_)
I chose to explore the different personas I've presented myself as online. Seeing all the data from my digital footprint was crazy because it dates back to when I was in middle school. The way I've presented myself on the internet since then has changed so many times. I took inspiration from Molly Sodas portfolio page, Mouchette, and Wallpaper Queens by Xanthe Dobbie. Definitely heavily inspired by early net art.
