!!!!Hey!!!!
This is my self as systems project :_)


For this project I chose to explore the different personas I've presented myself as online. Seeing all the data from my digital footprint was crazy because it dates back to when I was in middle school. The way I've presented myself on the internet since then has changed so many times. I took inspiration from Molly Sodas portfolio page, Mouchette by Martine Neddam, and Wallpaper Queens by Xanthe Dobbie. The piece was definitely heavily inspired by early net art. I wanted exploring the page to feel like diving into a wormhole of information, searching for what parts of data could teach you more about me. Picking through all my data gave me sensory overload, which was echoed by a lot of my other classmates too. The crowded style of the piece reflects this too. I was able to learn and find so much information about myself thats publicly available on the web. It was interesting to be reminded of and create a time capsule of different eras I've embodied. I was part of the first generation of kids to be exposed and use the internet at a very young age. Seeing the piles of data definitely made me reflect on this fact and how its affected me + will continue to.




Feedback I'd like: how discovering interactivity feels? Thoughts on the design work on different pages? how its loading for you?
