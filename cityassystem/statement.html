    <p>This site functions as a digital safe haven for people who are victims of domestic abuse as well as cyber-abuse. We offer guides to resources to in person shelters as well as police precincts and contact numbers. We also offer a chatroom that easily erases, so that the abusers cannot gain access to the resource. Here we hope to offer inclusive care for all victims of cyber-abuse and domestic violence.</p>
